In this implementation, we define a User class which represents a user with a first name, last name, email, and password. Then we define a Registration class which manages the registration process and stores a list of registered users.The add_user() method is used to add a new user to the list of registered users. It takes a first name, last name, email, and password as input and creates a new User object to represent the new user.The validate_email() method is used to perform basic email validation. In this example, it simply checks that the email contains the "@" and "." symbols.The validate_password() method is used to perform basic password validation. In this example, it checks that the password is at least 6 characters long.We then define a UserSession class which manages the user's registration state. It has a register() method which prompts the user to enter their first name, last name, email, and password, and calls the validate_input() method to perform basic validation on the input. If the input is valid, it calls the validate_email() and validate_password() methods of the Registration class to validate the email and password. If the email and password are valid, it calls


#Login API 
In this implementation, we define a User class which represents a user with a username and password. Then we define a Login class which manages the login process and stores a list of registered users.The add_user() method is used to add a new user to the list of registered users. The validate_user() method is used to validate a user's credentials. It takes a username and password as input and iterates through the list of registered users to check if the username and password match any of the registered users.We then define a UserSession class which manages the user's login state. It has a login() method which prompts the user to enter their username and password, and calls the validate_input() method to perform basic validation on the input. If the input is valid, it calls the validate_user() method of the Login class to validate the user's credentials. If the credentials are valid, it sets the username and logged_in attributes to indicate that the user is logged in. It also prints a message indicating that the login was successful.The logout() method sets the username and logged_in attributes to indicate that the user is logged out. It also prints a message indicating that the logout was successful.The validate_input() method performs basic validation on the username and password input to ensure that they meet certain requirements. In this example, it checks that they are not empty, are alphanumeric, and meet a minimum length requirement.Finally, we create an instance of the Login class and add two users to it. We then create an instance of the UserSession class and call its login() method to test the login functionality.


#Product Upload API 
In this updated implementation, we define a new Product class which represents a product with a name, barcode, brand, description, price, and availability. We then define a ProductInventory class which manages the inventory of products and stores a list of products.The add product method is used to add a new product to the list of products. It takes a Product object as input and appends it to the list of products.The get_products() method is used to return the list of products.We then define a AdminSession class which manages the admin user's session state. It has an upload products method which takes a filename as input and uploads products from a CSV file. It reads the CSV file using the csv.reader function and creates a new Product object for each row of the file, using the first column as the name, the second column as the barcode, the third column as the brand, the fourth column as the description, the fifth column as the price, and the sixth column as the availability. It then calls the add product method of the ProductInventory class to add the new product to the list of products.Note that in this implementation, we still assume that the admin user is already logged in and don't handle authentication or authorization. In a real-world implementation, you would need to add these mechanisms to ensure that only authorized admin users can upload products.


#Product Review API
In the above example, we define a Product class that has a reviews attribute which is a list of Review objects. We also define a User class that has a purchased_products attribute which is a dictionary of products that the user has purchased (indexed by the product barcode).The Product class has an add review method that takes a User object, a rating, and a comment as parameters. The method first checks if the user has purchased the product by looking it up in their purchased_products dictionary. If the user has purchased the product, a new Review object is created and added to the reviews list, otherwise an error message is returned.Finally, we show some example usage where we create some Product and User objects and have one user purchase a product and leave a review, while another user tries to leave a review for a product they haven't purchased (and is not allowed to).


#Product Pagination API
This is a Python script that defines several classes and an API for viewing a pagination of products, based on reviews.The Product class represents a product, with attributes such as name, price, barcode, brand, availability, and description. It also has a list of reviews associated with it, which can be added with the add_review() method and accessed with the get_reviews() method. The get_average_rating() method calculates the average rating based on the reviews associated with the product.The ProductInventory class represents a collection of products, with methods for adding products and getting a subset of products based on pagination parameters such as page size and page number, and sorting parameters such as sort by and ascending or descending order. The get_products() method returns a list of products that meet the pagination and sorting criteria.The Review class represents a review, with attributes for the user who wrote the review, the product being reviewed, the rating given, and any comments.The ProductViewPaginationAPI class provides an API for accessing and manipulating the products and reviews. It has methods for adding a product, getting a subset of products based on pagination and sorting criteria, and adding a review to a product.Finally, the script creates an instance of the ProductViewPaginationAPI class, adds several products to it, and adds reviews for those products. It then calls the get_products() method with pagination and sorting parameters to retrieve a subset of the products based on those criteria.
